----------------------------------------
Select the tablix
In Group section, right-click -> Add Group -> Parent Group
Name it something generic like "Group1"
Click the fx button for the group properties
For the expression, enter the following:
	-Ceiling((RowNumber(Nothing)) / 15)
	
Note : You can put Nth number in place of 15. 
For example if you want to your page break affect 
after each 25th row than you have to put 25 in place of 15 
	
Define Page Break for the group:
Under Group Properties, select Page Breaks from left menu.
Check the option "Between each instance of a group"

Personal Notes:
When creating a group, it add a column to the tablix. This column is
use to hold the index of the group. I found it better to set the cell to white font
and squeeze the column width very tightly to hide the column.
Doing helps avoid extra page breaks verus deleing the column and leaving the group.

# How to get rid of blank pages in PDF exported
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/362902/how-to-get-rid-of-blank-pages-in-pdf-exported-from-ssrs
----------------------------------------
To render in PDF correctly Body Width + Left margin + Right margin must be less than or equal to Page width. 
When you see blank pages being rendered it is almost always because the body width plus margins is greater 
than the page width.

Remember: (Body Width + Left margin + Right margin) <= (Page width)

Another option is to set the report property.
ConsumeContainerWhitespace to True (the default is false)
