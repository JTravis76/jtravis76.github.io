                            <h1>Jeremy R. Travis</h1>
                            <p class="lead">Out of high school, I worked a few plant labor jobs until the year of 2004; when I was ask for an office position. After learning the ropes of a new job, I began finding interest in database and ASP.NET. Been experimenting with Visual Studio C++ prior to this, thinking I wanted to be a game developer.</p>
                            <p>Working as an Office Professional, my boss had given me the liberty to improve a few processes. I quickly began to develop a dashboard to display our daily metrics using web form to save data entered by another employee. This replaces most of those boring spreadsheet.</p>
                            <p>Later learn, how powerful and useful VBA macros were in Microsoft Excel. I became a macro writing wizard. Soon, everyone wanted me to write scripts to help their daily tasks.</p>
                            <p>All that ended the year of 2009, as the plant was closing it door due to a buyout. I started working at Life Ambulance as a Tier I helpdesk. In a few months of quality work, I was promoted to Network / System Administrator. Two years later, First Med bought out Life Ambulance in July of 2011. Through hard work and willing to help the company, I developed a HR portal to integrate with in-house dispatch software. Which the portal eased in many Human Resource related tasks, mainly exporting employee hours into third-party vendor software for payroll.</p>
                            <p>In August 2012, I was promoted to .NET Developer / IT Specialist. Join the Development team to help write enhancement to the companyâ€™s dispatch software. Later, other projects such as; document management system, improvement in other portals for employees, billing department, etc.</p>
                            <h3>I design and build amazing things.</h3>
